# SSID

## What is SSID
SSID stands for Service Set Identifier, and it refers to the name of a wireless network. In the context of an Access Point (AP), the SSID is a unique identifier that distinguishes one wireless network from another. When you search for available Wi-Fi networks on your device, the list of networks you see is populated by their respective SSIDs.

## Why do we need SSID
SSID is necessary for several reasons:

- **Network Identification**: It helps users identify and connect to the desired wireless network among several available options.          
- **Security**: SSID plays a role in network security. It helps differentiate between secure and open networks, and users can configure their devices to automatically connect to specific SSIDs.             
- **Network Management**: For network administrators, SSID serves as a means to manage and organize different wireless networks within a specific area.   

## How to create SSID
1. Click on the **SSIDs** menu located on the left side.
