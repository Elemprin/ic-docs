# Bandwidth

## What is a Bandwidth Limit
A bandwidth limit refers to the maximum rate of data transfer across a network connection within a specific timeframe. It is often measured in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps). Bandwidth limits can be imposed by internet service providers (ISPs), network administrators, or the capabilities of the network hardware itself.

## Why do we need Bandwidth Limit
Bandwidth limits are crucial to effectively manage Internet speeds, ensure fair access for all users, and prevent any single user from monopolizing the available bandwidth. By setting bandwidth limits, administrators can control the speed of data transmission, and have flexibility. for **Ex:-** if the ISP is 200 MB if no limit is given, everything will use net speed. If there is more than one user, bandwidth limitation is used to manage them. Bandwidth limits are useful to prevent speed problems when everyone is using the same network at the same time so that everyone can enjoy and enjoy the same Internet speed.

## How to create Bandwidth Limit
